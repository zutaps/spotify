        - Read NLTK book
        - determine the NLTK modules 
        - determine feasability of making my own model vs using someone else
    - API Call / Data Scraping
        - Genius API call
        - Need another DF that lists my top 100 songs so I can attach lyrics to those songs
        - need another DF for month of most and least listening so i can attach lyrics to those songs

            - how to use the scripts together
            - reasoning for usage of NLTK or differnet model, Visualization Methods, and SQLite

Reasoning
    - NLTK or other model
    - Visualization
    - SQLite
        - Free
        - Can locally host it
        - Python Package SQLite3 works with it
        - Perfect for the size of data I have

Stretch Goal
    - make own model using NLTK and then use for Sentiment Analysis
    - Create visuals that move / experience is similar to Spotify Wrapped
    - Make UI so people can upload their own data and do the same

Risks
    - API calls
        - limits on Genius API calls 
            - mitigate by changing how many songs I get lyrics for
    - NLTK
        - never made a model before
        - could take a lot of time / not be a good model cause of data used
