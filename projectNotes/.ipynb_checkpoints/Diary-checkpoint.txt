1.25.25 = Started loading, separating, and cleaning streaming history data. Using jupyterlabs cause it is awesome and easy to use. also, by using display 
and read_json function and pandasql i am able to run sql queries without needing a separate sql database. Also i learned about datatime package and tomorrow will 
learn about conditional slicing in pandas. more efficient to do this because it allows me to filter data without having to loop through each row of the dataframe
and make comparison.
