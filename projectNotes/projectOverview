    - Understand sentiment Analysis
        - Read NLTK book
        - determine the NLTK modules 
        - determine feasability of making my own model vs using someone else
        - use sentiment analysis map (can be found on internet) = make sure to credit them on ReadMe
    - API Call / Data Scraping
        - Genius API call
        - Need another DF that lists my top 100 songs so I can attach lyrics to those songs
        - need another DF for month of most and least listening so i can attach lyrics to those songs
        - need to hide the Client Access Key
        - what about instrumental songs or songs that dont have lyrics on Genius? 
    - Visualization
        - Determine if I want to create graphics like current wrapped (use mary or ben for help)
        - Use Matplotlib or Plotly for charting interesting statistics or trends
    - Documentation
        - ReadMe file
            - include important insights
            - project goal
            - any challenges I faced 
            - how to use the scripts together
            - reasoning for usage of NLTK or differnet model, Visualization Methods, and SQLite
        - SQL Queries File
            - only list the SQL queries I wrote that showed me the interesting statistics

Reasoning
    - NLTK or other model
    - Visualization
    - ## Decided to use pandas and then use pandasql package to do sql queries
        - SQLite
            - Free
            - Can locally host it
            - Python Package SQLite3 works with it
            - Perfect for the size of data I have
        - ## Pandasql

Stretch Goal
    - make own model using NLTK and then use for Sentiment Analysis
    - Create visuals that move / experience is similar to Spotify Wrapped
    - Make UI so people can upload their own data and do the same

Risks
    - API calls
        - limits on Genius API calls 
            - mitigate by changing how many songs I get lyrics for
    - NLTK
        - never made a model before
        - could take a lot of time / not be a good model cause of data used
